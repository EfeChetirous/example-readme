Please refer to each project's style and contribution guidelines for submitting patches and additions. In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub.
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine.
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch.
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork.
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that I can review your changes.

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
